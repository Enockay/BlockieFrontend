            We understand that some of you have been experiencing **slower internet speeds** in recent days. This issue is **not caused by our system**, but rather due to adjustments made by our internet providers. These changes include **speed limitations and bandwidth restrictions** that may have affected your browsing experience.

            - **Considering infrastructure upgrades** that may require pricing adjustments.
